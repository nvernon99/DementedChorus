# Demented Chorus

VIDEO DEMO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cc4GX5TSGk

This is a parallel chorus effect which allows the user to control two seperate choruses as they effect the audio simulataneously. 
- It is very much a work in progress
- All the code is my own on top of the JUCE framework and library
- Available in VST3 and standalone (.exe) formats
